telepathy-gabble 0.6 (2008-02-14)
=================================
This is a maintenance release from the 0.6.x stable branch containing
several bugfixes backported from the development 0.7 branch.

Included are fixes for better XMPP1.0 support (optional SRV/TLS/SASL
feature support on Loudmouth>=1.3.2), better compatibility with
telepathy-glib > 0.7.0 (avoid warnings for writable properties,
properly set 'persist' flag), and improvements in disco support.
