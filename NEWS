telepathy-gabble 0.7.4 (unreleased)
===================================

Enhancements:

* fd.o #14467: aggregate MembersChanged signals when joining MUCs, so we
  get one big signal rather than lots of single-contact signals, potentially
  reducing client round-trips

* Re-enable some regression tests that were accidentally removed in 0.7.3

* Build documentation for our extensions to XMPP by default

Fixes:

* fd.o #12791: fix assertion failure with strange roster items

* fd.o #14343: fix race condition that can lose messages between accepting
  a D-Bus tube and actually connecting to it

* fd.o #15095: fix MUC contacts always appearing to be offline

* When removing a media stream before the initiate is sent, send it if possible

* when blocking gtalk contacts, discard their presence

* disconnect the connection if we don't receive a reply to the discovery
  request for server features

* stop using Automake 1.9 features, and prefer to autoreconf using 1.8 (if
  available) to ensure that we don't accidentally re-add a 1.9 dependency

telepathy-gabble 0.7.3 (2008-04-11)
===================================

Requirements:

* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.0 and Loudmouth >= 1.3.2 are now required

Enhancements:

* Implements the current draft of the Hold interface, which will be in
  telepathy-spec 0.17.4 if all goes well

* Improved Python regression test API and more regression tests:
  - outgoing Jingle calls
  - holding calls

Fixes:

* Only emit one AvatarRetrieved signal per contact, no matter how many
  requests there were for their avatar (fd.o #12465)

* Explicitly say we require GNU make, and turn off Automake portability
  warnings (fd.o #14020)

* Don't emit NewStreamHandler signals multiple times if Ready is called
  multiple times on the SessionHandler (a bug in stream-engine used to
  cause this to happen sometimes)

* Assorted code cleanup prompted by adding more gcc warnings

telepathy-gabble 0.7.2 (2008-01-17)
===================================
* Improvements to build system and code generation
* Tubes improvements
* Test improvements
  * Improvements to test framework
  * Most of the MUC tube code path is tested
* Saner behaviour of old-ssl/server/port/require-encryption flags
* Removal of unneccessary support hacks for N800-H263 and Nokia's
  Instant Video

telepathy-gabble 0.7.1 (2007-11-12)
===================================
This version detects whether Loudmouth >= 1.3.2 is present at build time;
if found, it uses STARTTLS whenever available, enables support for SASL and
SRV lookups, and has a require-encryption connection manager parameter which
makes the connection fail if STARTTLS cannot be used.

It also takes advantage of the debug infrastructure changes in
telepathy-glib 0.6.1 to separate the concepts of debug flags and
persistence.

telepathy-gabble 0.7.0 (2007-11-07)
===================================
This is the first release on the 0.7 development branch. The main change
is the addition of Tubes - we've finally managed to get the various
OLPC-specific branches reviewed and merged. We aim to get this release
into Update.1 of the OLPC system software.

Highlights:

* All the same bug fixes as stable branch release 0.6.1

* Tubes, a generic transport for collaborative applications:
  * multi-user D-Bus tubes, where the collaboration is in a MUC (chat room)
    which behaves a lot like the D-Bus daemon
  * one-to-one D-Bus tubes, which behave a lot like peer-to-peer D-Bus
    connections
  * multi-user stream tubes, where one user in a MUC exports a Unix,
    IPv4 or IPv6 server socket and other users can connect to it
  * one-to-one stream tubes, just like multi-user but without the MUC

* Support for the OLPC Activity and Buddy abstractions

* A man page and some protocol documentation

* The connection manager binary now installs to $libexecdir -
  distributors take note!

D-Bus tubes require libdbus-1 version 1.0.2 or better; if you compile
against an older version of libdbus you won't get D-Bus tubes support.
